/**
 * The dictionary, as the tests see it: every key answers with itself.
 *
 * `vi.mock("@/lib/i18n", () => import("../helpers/i18n"))` at the top of a test
 * file, and an assertion reads `cp.action.add_operator` instead of "Оператор
 * нэмэх". That is deliberate. A test written against the Mongolian wording
 * fails when somebody improves the wording, which teaches the next person that
 * the suite is noise; a test written against the key fails only when the screen
 * shows something else, which is what it is for.
 *
 * That whether a key exists at all is not checked here is not an omission: it
 * is `npm run i18n:check`'s job, and it checks all seven languages rather than
 * the one a test happened to render in.
