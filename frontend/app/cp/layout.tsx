 * The operator console's routes exist only on the console's hostname.
 *
 * This is a server component so the decision is made before any of it is sent:
 * a request to nexus.gerege.mn/cp gets the 404 page, not the console's HTML
 * with a client-side redirect after it. The same rule is enforced again by the
 * API (controlplane.HostGate) and again by nginx's address allowlist — three
 * layers, none of which is asked to trust another.
 *
 * CONTROL_PLANE_HOST is read here rather than baked in as NEXT_PUBLIC_*,
 * because a NEXT_PUBLIC_ value is compiled into the bundle every visitor
 * downloads, and the console's hostname is not something the public build
 * should be carrying around.
 *
 * The frame is here rather than inside each page. A layout survives a
 * navigation between the routes under it, so moving between screens now
 * redraws the work area and nothing else: the header, the rail and the module
 * panel keep their state, and the session is read once rather than on every
 * click. Every /cp page used to open with `<Console>` around it, which made
 * each click a fresh mount of the whole shell — an unavoidable flash of the
 * loading state, and a `cp.me()` per screen.
