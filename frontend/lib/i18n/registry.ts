 * Where an app's translations arrive from.
 *
 * The dictionary used to be one `as const` object built in index.tsx out of
 * twenty-five imports and twenty-five spreads, with five overlay files of about
 * 1381 lines each beside it. Adding an app meant editing all of them, which is
 * why they were among the files app work dragged along with it: the locale
 * files were changed by 21 of the last app commits, and the file that assembles
 * them by nearly as many. Not because anybody wanted a shared dictionary — because
 * there was nowhere else for an app's words to go.
 *
 * Now there is. An app hands its own strings over at import time:
 *
 *     registerDictionary("urtuu", { ...source(urtuu), ar, zh, fr, ru, es });
 *
 * and a distribution's app does exactly the same, for keys this repository has
 * never heard of. The core dictionary stays compile-time — see core.ts, where
 * TranslationKey comes from — so a typo in a platform key is still a build
 * error. An app key is a string, and t() takes either.

 * capturing a merged object, so an app registered after the provider mounted is
 * translated from that moment. In practice every app in this repository
 * registers at import time, before React renders anything — see apps/index.ts
 * for why that is deliberate rather than incidental.
 *
 * Registering the same appId twice replaces what it had. Two different apps
 * claiming one key is the case worth hearing about, so that is the one warned
 * about — in development only, because a warning nobody can act on in a
 * production console is noise.
